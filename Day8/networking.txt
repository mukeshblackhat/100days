UDP : user datagram protocol
 ->data may or may not deleivered 
 ->data may change 
 -> data may corrupt 
 -> data may not be in order 

 {connectionless protocol}

 uses checksum but it doesnt care that whethere data is corrupted or not 

 lets talk about what UDP packets carry with them 

 first talk about headers :
    -> source port number 
    -> destination port number 
    -> length og datagram 
    -> checksum 
secondly it carries data that it transfers 

UDP is faster so it is used for vedio calling , gaming , also in DNS 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

lets talk about TCP 

TCP : transmission control protocol 

data is mainly transfered between network layer and transport layer 

-> transport layer protocol 
-> application layer sends lots of the raw data 
-> tcp segments this data and divide it into chuncks
-> add headers 
-> it may also connect the data network layer 
-> congestion control 
-> takes care of two thing 
   1. when data doen't arrived 
   2. maintain order of data 

features of the tcp 
  -> connection oriented 
  -> error control 
  -> conjestion control 
  -> bidirectional , full duplex 


3 way handshake :
  1. client send a SYN flag and seq. not to server 
  2. server send the ACK flag with seq no. of its own and ACK no. (which is privious step seq. no.)
  3. then client send back the ACK falg with next seq no. and ACK no. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Network layer :
here we work with routers 


layer        how data transfer take place 

transport    segments
network      packets 
datalink     frames 



as we deal with routers in network layer so we know that each router have their own 
network layer address by which it is identified outside the layer 

192.168.2.30
here 
192.168.2-> is network address 
30 -> your device address 

their are some things called 
routing table 
router hopping 
forwarding table 
control panel : build routing table 
routes are like the nodes and links between then are like edges 

routing are done in two ways one is 
routing in static way which is done manually 
other is dynamic routing take place by its own 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Internet protocol (IP)
their is are two types of it 
ipv4 and ipv6 both are different and 
ipv4 is bidirectional and ipv6 is not bidirectional 

when we talk about the ip addresses then their are some classes of protocols 

classes of ip addresses 
a 0.0.0.0->127.255.255.255
b 128.0.0.0-> 191.255.255.255
c 192.0.0.0-> 223.255.255.255
d 224.0.0.0->239.255.255.255
e 240.0.0.0->255.255.255.255

in very begining the ip addresses are allocated by first come first take but after wards 
it is provided according to region specific not classes specific 
 
 we can have different subnet part which is specific and can be dynamic
 12.0.0.0.0/31 here 31 reperesent that first 31 bits are reserved for subnet and rest can be used

 some addressed are reserved like 
 127.0.0.0.0/8 
 for local host 
 for loop call back 

 Packets : here header is of 20bytes and 
   it contains ipv , length , indentifiers , flags , protocols , checksums , ttl( time to leave ),etx



these all are about ipv4 now lets talk about ipv6 

ipv6 is version 6 and not yet fully estaiblished and using 
it contains 128 bits so ti can create lot of ip address 

cons : not backword compatible 
     : isps would have to shift , lot of hardware work 





Middle boxes these are something also need to discussed 
these contain 
1. firewall 
   it is about global internet and your trusted network 
   it filter out ip packets based on various rules 
   1. addresses 
   2. modify packets 
   3. port no's 
   4. flags
   5. protocols 

   firewalls are both stateless and statefull but statefull is more effective 
 it can be found in transort as well network layer 

2. network address translation 
  it is also a nice concept 


  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Data link layer 

  it is the last layer we need to disscuss to know about internet 
  here every router have ip address by which isp identify them 
  every router assign new ip to each device connnected to it using DHCP 

  now lets see how is data transfered here in this 

  devices are connected in the LAN  using : data link layer address 
  when one device send request it see all the cache of the device using ARP {address resolution protocol }

  when not found in cache it send a request to everydevice assking about is it your address with DLLa of sender 
  and with ip address of destination 
  and this is done with framing {data fragments like packets }
