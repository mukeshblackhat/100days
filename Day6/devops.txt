as we learned about pop3 protocol for email 

their is one more protocol by which we can access aur send and recieve mail 
 >IMAP : internet mail access protocol 
    ->  can view email on multiple devices 
    -> kept of server till deleted 
    -> multiple local copies made for users 


now lets talk about we get the ip of the domain names lets look into DNS which is resposible for this 

DNS : domain name system (used to find I.P. address of server)

     mail.google.com 
     mail---> sub domain 
     google -----> second level domain 
     com -------> top level domain 


Root DNS server
--> have top level domain {.in , .com , .tech , .org }
these are managed by ICANN 

when we talk about how dns work it first check in cookies and then to isp and after that to root server 
rootserver send it to the ISP where then it goes to Top level domain then it get info about it required .

you can check about the dns respones with terminal 
~dig google.com
~man dig

2. TRANSPORT LAYER 

transport layer works between application layer and network layer 
network layer work to handle the data that goes between  the users 
sockets are attaiched to the transport layer to handle the data sent to which tab or maiatain the connection between the network  layer and application layer 
when we send multiple messeges , files , voice calls then then transport layer multiplex the data and on the reciever side Demultiple handle the 
data back to separation 

transport layer also handle the conjestion happing with the data flow through layer 
their are some conjestion layer which help in controlling the congestion of the data request and transportation 

while transfering the data , we should be aware of the thing that we dont loose any data for that 
we use CHECKSUMS they are provided with data and on other side after data assembled back then they apply checksum to recheck whether this 
is all the data that is send of something else .


Timmer : 
how to we know that something is lost or now we use timmer theri to calculate the time for the transmission of the data between the users 
and to know where the packet is lost or not .
while their can be mainy poosibilities that can take place while data transmission with duplication of the data packet 
for avoiding the duplication of the data problems we use Sequence number
