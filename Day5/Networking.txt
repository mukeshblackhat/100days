today i learned about :

program consists of lot of process and each process contain lot of threads 

taking example of whatsapp :
whatsapp is program 
send messege , calls , status -> process
camera access, creating msg page , accessing photo -> threads 
 thread(single jobs only ...)

if we want to connect and want to send messeges then we need to use 
Socket : send msg from one place to another 
       : software process for application layer 
       : interface between process and internet 


Ports : used for the identification of the application 
        { but which tab in that web application }

     : Ephemeral Ports {assign random port number for the time being and after termination of the tab it empty the port and available to reassign }


HTTP : {client server protocol }
     : application layer protocol 
     :every application layer protocol require transport layer protocols {UDP, TCP}
     :it uses TCP for transportation 
     :stateless protocol
     :server will not store client data 

HTTP methods telling server what to do 
  >GET getting info 
  >POST give to server
  >PUT edit the data
  >DELETE remove the data 


  Status for the type of the response accordingly 
  1XX -> information category 
  2XX -> success response 
  3XX -> redirection purpose 
  4XX -> client error
  5XX -> server error


  if http is stateless then how the server identify our 
  login activity : use the cookies -> unique string 
  cookies are stored in browser 

  their are also third party cookies :
   cookies for sites u never visited .

   # how email works 
   protocols used for emails 

   >>SMTP (for sending)
   >>POP3 (for receving)

   SMTP uses TCP no data loss is tollerated 

   here is example 

   sender ----> sender SMTP server ------> receiver SMTP server -------> reciever
   only if they have different email then this connection establish 

   if they have same then they can send msg directly without server connection 
   like both having gmail.com

   we can also get our gmail server ip 
   by command 
   >> ~nslookup -type =mn gmail.com 

   for SMTP server of gmail 

   POP -> post office protocol
       -> port 110 
       -> authorization -> client ask for all his emials in server 
       it dont include drafts and other folder of gmail we see
