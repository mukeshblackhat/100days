Networking ...

Internet :- it is group of computers sharing info 

OSI model for tranfering data across devices 
  > there are 7 layers in osi model 
    >>Application layer : client interaction (web interaction and browsers)
    >>Presentation Layer: encription / decription / compression of data consver of ASCII to etsm 
    >>Session Layer : authenticate / authorise and establish connection 
    >>Transport Layer:brakes the data into packets and error control and assign of port number and sequence number 
    >>Network Layer:routers work over here / load balancing take place with assigning of ip address to the packates for data transfer
    >>Data link Layer:for assining of the mac address 
    >>Physical Layer: cabels , elctric signal , light signal , radio signals 

IP address : X.X.X.X  0<x<255
isp provides a modern and their is one ip address assigned to it and shown as your ip over internet 
using DHCP protocol (dynamic host config protocol)
  > to assign local ip to all devices in a modem 
TCP (total transmission protocol) 100% of data tranfer is ensured
UDP : some data loss can be manages like during vedio call some frames loss can be compromised 
HTTP: for taransfer of the data over web 
PN: port number for getting application 
SN: sequence number for data packets to reassemble the data correctly 
0-1023 ports are reserved and 1024-49152 are reseved for the private application 


OSI model is more like theoretical then being practical 

TCP/IP model is practical MODEL  used more with five layers 
 >> application layer
 >>transfer layer
 >>network layer
 >>Data link layer
 >>physical layer


 now lets talk in depth about 
 >>> Application Layer
     users interact with this layer 
     on your devices 
     there are several protocols to transfer data 

     >here are two architecture for data transfer about client server connection 
         >>client server architecture 
         >>peer to peer architecture 
         >>hybride architecture 
        
    
some general terms and devices 
  
  1. repeater : regenerate signal over same natwork 
               >operates in physical layer
               >it dosn't amplify the signal 
               
  2. Hub : collection of repeater(star topology)
      >Acitve Hub : clean boost and relay the signal 
                  : use to extent maximum node 
                  : server are both repeter as well wiring repeter
      >Passive Hub :supply from active hub 
                   :no cleaning , no boost , no centeral disk

  3. Bridge : at data link layer 
            : additional functionality by adding two port bridge input and output 

  4. Switch  : multiport bridge 
             : error checking 

  5. Gateway : to connect two network working on different networking model 



# protocols 
  * TCP/IP
    >HTTP 
    >DHCP
    >FTP-> file transfer protocol 
    >SMTP->simple mail transfer protocol 
    >POP3 /IMAC -> to recieve emails
    >SSH->for remote login to others terminal 
    >VNC->vertical network computing for graphical control 

  * TELNET(port:23) 
    >manage account or devices remotely
