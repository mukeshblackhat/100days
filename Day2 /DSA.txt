today i studied about Stack :

data structure is type of ds where 
data structure  is Last In Fast Out 
LIFO 

in STL we have seen some common issues
 create stack 

 stack <int>  Name;

 Name.push();
 Name.pop();
 Name.empty();
 Name.top();

 these are some common function that we will impliment 
 stack can be implimented by two ways 
 either by 
 * Arrays 
 * linked list 

 creating a class and implimenting using array is easy task ;
